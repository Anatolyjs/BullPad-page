This is my first commercial project for little start up named BullPad.

Currently this is a just a test app with fake data. Soon it will be full-fledged working project. This page has been adapted to different devices.

User technologies: 
React, 
Redux, 
React-hook-form, 
React-redux, 
redux-thunk, 
HTML, 
SASS(SCSS), 
JavaScript.

Use "npm install" to download necessary modules. Then "npm start" and your app will be launched in the Browser.
